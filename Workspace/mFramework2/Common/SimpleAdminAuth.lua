---* IsAdminPlayer
-- | Checks if a given steamId is listed in a `admins.txt` file in server root `MiscreatedServer/admins.txt`
-- | Will Print an Error in The log and return false if the file does not exist
-- | admins.txt should have ONE steamId per line (to help remember who is who, its also ok to use the format: name steamId )
---@param steamId string: players steam64Id
---@return boolean, string
--- if the steamid was found returns true or false plus a message if not
